# Local Development Requirements for Quantum Computing 101 Examples
# Purpose: Complete package set for running ALL examples WITHOUT Docker
# Used by: Local pip installation, CI/CD pipelines, manual setup
# Sync: Keep core packages aligned with docker/requirements/base.txt
# Note: Some packages (Jupyter, cloud SDKs) intentionally overlap with Docker for flexibility

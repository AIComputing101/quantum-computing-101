# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our quantum computing education community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on making quantum computing education accessible to all.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

### ‚úÖ Encouraging Behaviors
- **Being welcoming to newcomers**: Remember that everyone starts as a beginner in quantum computing
- **Demonstrating empathy and kindness**: Be patient with questions and learning processes
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints**: Quantum computing has many approaches and perspectives
- **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback**: Help improve code, documentation, and understanding
- **Accepting responsibility**: Acknowledge mistakes and learn from them
- **Focusing on community benefit**: Prioritize what helps the quantum computing education community
- **Showing appreciation**: Recognize and thank contributors for their efforts

### Educational Focus
- **Encouraging learning**: Support questions and experimentation, even if they seem basic
- **Sharing knowledge**: Help others understand quantum concepts and programming techniques
- **Promoting accessibility**: Make quantum computing understandable for diverse backgrounds
- **Celebrating progress**: Acknowledge learning milestones and achievements

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

### ‚ùå Prohibited Behaviors
- **Harassment**: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- **Trolling**: Insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- **Discrimination**: Public or private harassment based on any protected characteristic
- **Privacy violations**: Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- **Gatekeeping**: Dismissing or discouraging people based on their experience level
- **Academic dishonesty**: Plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, or misrepresentation of work
- **Spam or self-promotion**: Excessive promotion of unrelated projects or commercial content

### Quantum Computing Specific
- **Spreading misinformation**: Sharing incorrect quantum computing concepts without correction
- **Dismissing educational approaches**: Criticizing different learning methods without constructive alternatives
- **Elitism**: Making others feel unwelcome due to their technical background or institution

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: aicomputing101@gmail.com
- **Anonymous Form**: [Anonymous Reporting Form](https://forms.example.com/conduct-report)
- **GitHub**: For public issues, use the repository's issue tracker

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

### Investigation Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Reports will be acknowledged within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Community leaders will review the incident fairly and thoroughly
3. **Decision**: Appropriate action will be determined based on the severity and context
4. **Communication**: Relevant parties will be informed of the decision and reasoning
5. **Appeal**: A process exists for appealing decisions if new information emerges

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Educational Philosophy

This Code of Conduct supports our mission to make quantum computing education accessible and welcoming. We believe that:

- **Everyone can learn quantum computing** with proper support and resources
- **Diverse perspectives strengthen** our educational community
- **Questions are valuable** regardless of experience level
- **Teaching is a responsibility** we all share
- **Mistakes are learning opportunities** not reasons for shame

## Positive Examples

### In GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
‚úÖ "Thanks for the contribution! Here's a suggestion to make the quantum circuit more efficient..."
‚úÖ "I'm new to quantum computing. Could someone explain why we use a Hadamard gate here?"
‚úÖ "Great example! Would it be helpful to add a visualization of the Bloch sphere evolution?"

‚ùå "This is obviously wrong. Did you even study quantum mechanics?"
‚ùå "Another beginner question. Use Google."
‚ùå "Only people with physics PhDs should contribute to quantum computing projects."

### In Documentation and Code Reviews
‚úÖ "This explanation of superposition could be clearer. Maybe we could add an analogy?"
‚úÖ "Nice implementation! Consider adding error handling for edge cases."
‚úÖ "The code works well. Here's an optimization that might help with larger quantum circuits."

‚ùå "This documentation is terrible."
‚ùå "Why don't you know how to use Git properly?"
‚ùå "Real quantum programmers don't need comments."
